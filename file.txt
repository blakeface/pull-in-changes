Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full!

One for the master,
One for the dame,
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane

Baa, baa, black sheep,
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir,
Three bags full...

Baa, baa, white sheep,
have you any wool?
yes sir, yes sir,
three needles full.

one to mend a jumper,
one to mend a frock,
and one for the little girl,
with holes in her sock.
